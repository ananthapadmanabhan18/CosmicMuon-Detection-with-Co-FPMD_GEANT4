In this report we will discuss about the basics of the group theory and symmetries.
The Group Theory is used as a mathematical frame work for describing symmetry properties 
of classical as well as quantum systems. We will also read about Homomorphisms-a 
structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type, 
Conjugations, and some applications of the Group theory in different fields 
like the crystallography and Topologies etc.
