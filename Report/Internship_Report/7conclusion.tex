\section{Conclusion}

So far in this report we 1st discussed and learned about the basic definition of the Groups and saw some examples, then we discussed about the mappings from and to the groups, Homomorphisms, Action, conjugation etc and in the last part we saw some application of the group theory in some Fields like the Crystallography and in the topology of some groups namely SO(3). We were able to study and prove some of the basic theorems and formulas in the group theory like in the Lorentz transformations, Lorentz Boosts, etc. So, Finally, we could see that the group theory has many applications in physics and Chemistry.
